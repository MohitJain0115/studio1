          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground">Making the Most of Your Time Between Flights: A Traveler's Handbook</h2>
          <p>A layover can be anything from a frantic dash between gates to a mini-vacation in itself. The key to a stress-free connection is understanding exactly how much time you have and what you can realistically do with it. This guide demystifies the layover, explaining the difference between total layover time and usable time, factors that eat into your buffer, and how to determine if you have enough time to leave the airport.</p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Total Layover vs. Usable Time: A Critical Distinction</h3>
          <p>The first and most important concept to grasp is that your total layover duration is not your "free time." Our calculator provides the total time from when your first plane is scheduled to arrive at the gate to when your second plane is scheduled to depart. However, several factors will reduce this total, leaving you with your actual "usable time."</p>
          <p>Here's a typical breakdown of how your layover time gets spent:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Deplaning (15-30 minutes):</strong> It takes time to get off the aircraft, especially if you are seated at the back.</li>
            <li><strong>Navigating the Airport (15-45 minutes):</strong> This includes walking to your next gate. For large international hubs like Dubai (DXB) or Atlanta (ATL), this can involve long walks, bus rides, or train journeys between terminals.</li>
            <li><strong>Security and Immigration (Domestic vs. International):</strong>
                <ul className='list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2'>
                    <li><strong>Domestic Layover:</strong> If you stay within the same terminal and don't exit the secure area, you usually don't need to go through security again.</li>
                    <li><strong>International Layover:</strong> You will almost certainly have to go through immigration/passport control upon arrival and then a full security screening before proceeding to your connecting flight's gate. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to over 2 hours during peak times.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Boarding for Connecting Flight (30-60 minutes):</strong> Airlines typically begin boarding 30-60 minutes before the scheduled departure time. The gate will close 15-20 minutes before takeoff, and you must be on the plane by then.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Minimum Connection Times (MCT): The Airline's Guideline</h3>
          <p>Airlines have a "Minimum Connection Time" (MCT) for every airport, which is the shortest time they will allow you to book a connecting flight. This is their calculated minimum for you to make the connection under ideal conditions. MCTs typically range from 45 minutes for a simple domestic connection to over 2 hours for a complex international one.</p>
          <p>While the airline won't sell you a ticket that violates the MCT, this is an absolute minimum. It does not account for delays with your inbound flight, long queues at security, or any desire to eat, use the restroom, or relax. A good rule of thumb is to have at least 60 minutes on top of the airport's MCT for a comfortable connection.</p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">The Million-Dollar Question: Can I Leave the Airport?</h3>
          <p>Leaving the airport during a layover is tempting but requires careful planning. Use this checklist to decide:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Calculate Usable Time:</strong> Subtract all the buffer times from your total layover. As a rough guide:
                <p className="font-mono text-sm p-2 bg-muted rounded-md mt-2">Usable Time ≈ Total Layover - 1 hour (deplaning/navigating) - 2 hours (return security/boarding) = Total Layover - 3 hours.</p>
                For international layovers, add at least another hour for immigration on both ends, making it closer to `Total Layover - 4 to 5 hours`.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Factor in Travel to the City:</strong> Research how long it takes to get from the airport to a point of interest and back. This can be 30 minutes to over an hour each way.</li>
            <li><strong>Check Visa Requirements:</strong> If you are on an international layover, you must have the proper visa or be from a visa-exempt country to enter the country the airport is in.</li>
            <li><strong>Baggage:</strong> If you checked a bag, will it be transferred automatically to your final destination, or do you need to collect it and re-check it? If you have to re-check it, this adds significant time and makes leaving the airport very difficult.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>General Rule of Thumb:</strong> For a domestic layover, you need at least **4-5 hours** to comfortably leave the airport. For an international layover, a minimum of **7-8 hours** is recommended.</p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Making the Most of a Short Layover (Under 3 Hours)</h3>
          <p>If you can't leave the airport, you can still make your layover enjoyable:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Find an Airport Lounge:</strong> Many airports have lounges accessible via credit card perks, loyalty status, or by purchasing a day pass. They offer comfortable seating, Wi-Fi, food, and drinks.</li>
            <li><strong>Explore the Airport Art and Exhibits:</strong> Many modern airports have impressive art installations, gardens (like in Singapore's Changi), or small museums.</li>
            <li><strong>Enjoy a Proper Meal:</strong> Instead of rushing, use the time to sit down at a decent airport restaurant.</li>
            <li><strong>Get Some Exercise:</strong> Walk the length of the terminals. Some airports even have dedicated walking paths or gyms.</li>

              <AccordionContent>

              <AccordionContent>
                <p>If both flights were booked on the same ticket, the airline is responsible for rebooking you on the next available flight at no extra charge. If you booked the two flights separately, you are responsible, and you may have to buy a new ticket.</p>

              <AccordionContent>
                <p>On most domestic and many international layovers (booked on one ticket), your bags will be automatically transferred. However, when entering certain countries (like the USA), you are often required to collect your bags, go through customs, and then re-check them. Always confirm with the airline when you first check in.</p>

              <AccordionTrigger>What's the difference between a layover and a stopover?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                <p>A layover is a connection of less than 24 hours. A stopover is a connection longer than 24 hours, which many airlines allow you to book, sometimes for free, to explore a city for a day or more as part of your journey.</p>

            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem value="item-6">
              <AccordionTrigger>Does this calculator work for train or bus layovers?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                <p>Yes. The principle is exactly the same. As long as you know the local arrival and departure times, you can use it to calculate the time you have between any two segments of your journey.</p>
