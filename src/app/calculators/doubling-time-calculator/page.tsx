            <p>Doubling time is a concept that vividly illustrates the power of exponential growth. It answers a simple but profound question: "At a constant rate of growth, how long until this thing gets twice as big?" The answer is often surprisingly short, which is why understanding doubling time is a cornerstone of financial literacy, demography, and science.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">The Rule of 72: A Powerful Mental Tool</h3>
            <p>The "Rule of 72" is one of the most useful rules of thumb in finance. It allows for a remarkably accurate, back-of-the-napkin calculation of how long an investment will take to double, without complex math.</p>
            <p>By simply dividing 72 by the percentage growth rate, you get a close estimate. This works for both positive and negative scenarios:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li>An investment earning **8%** per year will double in approximately `72 / 8 = 9` years.</li>
                <li>If inflation is **3%** per year, the cost of goods will double (and the value of your money will halve) in approximately `72 / 3 = 24` years.</li>
                <li>A national debt growing at **4%** a year will double in `72 / 4 = 18` years.</li>

            <p>The concept of doubling time is not limited to money. It's a fundamental measure of exponential processes in many fields:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Population Studies:</strong> Demographers use doubling time to project how long it will take for a country's population to double, which has massive implications for infrastructure, food supply, and resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology (Moore's Law):</strong> The famous observation that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years is a classic example of a predictable doubling time driving technological progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Biology & Epidemiology:</strong> In a favorable environment, a bacterial colony can have a doubling time of just 20 minutes. During a pandemic, the doubling time of cases is a critical metric for public health officials to gauge the speed of transmission and the need for interventions.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Science:</strong> Understanding the doubling time of resource consumption (like energy or water) is key to planning for a sustainable future.</li>

              <AccordionTrigger>Why does the Rule of 72 work?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                <p>It's a mathematical approximation derived from the more precise logarithmic formula. The natural logarithm of 2 is approximately 0.693. For small interest rates, `ln(1 + r) ≈ r`. This gives rise to the "Rule of 69.3". However, 72 is used instead because it's a highly composite number (divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12), making mental division easy for a wide range of common rates. It also happens to provide better accuracy for the rates typically encountered in finance (5% to 12%).</p>

              <AccordionTrigger>What does "period" mean in the result?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                <p>A "period" is the unit of time over which the growth rate is applied. It's crucial to match them. If you enter an annual growth rate (e.g., 8% per year), the doubling time will be in years. If you enter a monthly growth rate (e.g., 1% per month), the doubling time will be in months.</p>

             <AccordionItem value="item-3">
              <AccordionTrigger>Does the initial amount of money or population matter?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                <p>No. For a constant percentage growth rate, the time it takes for a quantity to double is independent of the starting amount. It takes just as long for $100 to grow to $200 as it does for $1 million to grow to $2 million at the same compound rate. This is a key feature of exponential growth.</p>

            <AccordionItem value="item-4">
              <AccordionTrigger>How accurate is the Rule of 72 compared to the exact formula?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                <p>The Rule of 72 is most accurate for rates around 8%. For lower or higher rates, its accuracy diminishes slightly, but it remains a remarkably good estimate for most practical purposes. For example, at 2% growth, the Rule of 72 gives 36 years, while the exact formula gives 35 years. At 15% growth, the rule gives 4.8 years, while the exact is 4.96 years.</p>

              <AccordionTrigger>Can I use this for halving time (decay)?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                <p>Yes, the same logic applies. If you have a quantity that decreases by a certain percentage per period (like radioactive decay), you can use the Rule of 72 to estimate its half-life. For example, if a value decreases by 5% per year, its halving time is approximately `72 / 5 = 14.4` years.</p>

              <AccordionTrigger>What are the limitations of this calculation?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                <p>The primary limitation is the assumption of a *constant* growth rate. In the real world, investment returns, population growth, and other metrics fluctuate over time. This calculator provides a useful projection based on a steady rate, but it is not a prediction of the future. It's a tool for understanding the power of a specific growth rate, not for guaranteeing future outcomes.</p>
