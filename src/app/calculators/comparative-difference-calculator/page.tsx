            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground">Choosing the Right Tool for Comparison</h2>
            <p>Percentage calculations can be confusing because the "correct" method depends entirely on the context and the question you're trying to answer. The two primary ways to compare values are Percentage Change (what our Historic Change and Sale Discount calculators do) and Percentage Difference (what this calculator does). Knowing which one to use is crucial for accurate analysis.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Percentage Change: A Directional Comparison</h3>
            <p>Use a percentage change calculation when you have a clear "before" and "after" scenario. This method measures the change from an original or reference value to a new value. The formula is `((New - Old) / Old) * 100`.</p>
            <p>Key characteristics:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>It is directional.</strong> The change from 100 to 150 is a 50% increase, but the change from 150 to 100 is a 33.3% decrease. The starting point matters.</li>
                <li><strong>It is not symmetrical.</strong> As shown above, reversing the values does not simply reverse the sign of the percentage.</li>
                <li><strong>Common Use Cases:</strong> Stock price movement, sales growth from one quarter to the next, calculating a discount from an original price.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Percentage Difference: A Symmetrical Comparison</h3>
            <p>Use a percentage difference calculation when you are comparing two values on equal footing, without designating one as the 'original' point. This method expresses the difference as a percentage of the average of the two values.</p>
            <p>Key characteristics:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>It is symmetrical.</strong> The percentage difference between 100 and 150 is the same as the percentage difference between 150 and 100. The order of inputs does not change the result.</li>
                <li><strong>It avoids bias.</strong> By using the average as the denominator, it doesn't give more weight to either value.</li>
                <li><strong>Common Use Cases:</strong> Comparing statistics between two different groups (e.g., test scores of two schools), comparing measurements in a scientific experiment, or any situation where you want to know the magnitude of the difference without implying a temporal or causal relationship.</li>

              <AccordionTrigger>Why is the denominator the average of the two numbers?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                <p>Using the average of the two numbers ensures that the comparison is neutral. If you used either Value A or Value B as the denominator (as in a percentage change calculation), you would be implying that one value is the 'correct' or 'original' reference point, which isn't the case in a symmetrical comparison.</p>
              </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem value="item-2">
              <AccordionTrigger>Can the result be negative?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                <p>No. By definition, this formula uses the absolute difference (`|Value A - Value B|`), so the result is always a non-negative percentage representing the magnitude of the difference.</p>
              </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionItem>
             <AccordionItem value="item-3">
              <AccordionTrigger>Is this the same as "relative error"?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                <p>The concept is very similar. In experimental science, "relative error" often compares an experimental value to a known or theoretical value. In that case, the theoretical value is typically used as the denominator. This calculator is for when there is no single 'correct' or theoretical value, and both numbers are of equal status.</p>

             <AccordionItem value="item-4">
              <AccordionTrigger>What happens if one value is zero?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                <p>If one value is zero (e.g., Value A = 0, Value B = 100), the calculation still works. The absolute difference is 100, the average is 50, so the percentage difference is (100 / 50) * 100 = 200%. This can seem counter-intuitive, but it correctly represents the relationship in the context of the formula.</p>
