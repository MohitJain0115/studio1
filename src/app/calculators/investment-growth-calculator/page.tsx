            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground">Beyond the Numbers: What Does Growth Really Mean?</h2>
            <p>At its core, investing is about making your money work for you. The goal is to turn a starting sum into a larger sum. This calculator gives you the two most basic metrics for success: how much money you made (net profit) and how efficiently you made it (percentage growth). While simple, these numbers are the foundation of performance tracking.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Percentage Growth (ROI) vs. Net Profit</h3>
            <p>It's important to look at both metrics together. A $10,000 net profit sounds great, but its significance changes with context:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li>If that $10,000 profit came from a **$1,000,000** investment, your percentage growth is only **1%**. That's likely less than inflation, meaning you lost purchasing power.</li>
                <li>If that same $10,000 profit came from a **$20,000** investment, your percentage growth is **50%**. That is a fantastic return.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Percentage growth, or Return on Investment (ROI), is the great equalizer. It allows you to compare the performance of different sized investments on an apples-to-apples basis. Net profit tells you the real-world cash value of your success.</p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">What This Calculator Doesn't Tell You</h3>
            <p>This is a simple growth calculator. For a complete picture of investment performance, several other factors are critical:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Time Horizon:</strong> A 50% gain is amazing if it happens in one year. It's less impressive if it took 20 years. To account for time, you need to calculate the annualized rate of return (see our Compounding Increase Calculator for related concepts).</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Contributions/Withdrawals:</strong> This calculator assumes a single investment with no money added or removed. Real-world portfolios often have ongoing contributions, which complicates ROI calculations.</li>
                <li><strong>Dividends and Interest:</strong> This calculation is based purely on capital appreciation (the change in price). It doesn't explicitly factor in gains from dividends or interest payments unless they are already reflected in the "Final Value".</li>
                <li><strong>Risk:</strong> A 50% return is great, but not if it involved a huge risk of losing everything. Evaluating returns without considering the associated risk is a common mistake.</li>
            </ul>

              <AccordionContent>
                <p>Yes, the "Total Growth (%)" is the simplest form of ROI. The formula is identical: `(Net Profit / Cost of Investment) * 100`.</p>

              <AccordionContent>
                <p>Yes, for the most accurate calculation of your true return. Your 'Initial Investment' should be the total cost basis, which includes the purchase price plus any fees or commissions you paid to acquire the asset.</p>

              <AccordionContent>
                <p>The calculator works perfectly for losses. If your final amount is less than your initial amount, the "Total Growth" will be negative (e.g., -25%) and the "Net Profit" will also be a negative number, representing your net loss.</p>
