            <h1 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-extrabold text-foreground mb-4">Making Healthcare Affordable: A Deep Dive into ACA Subsidies</h1>
            <p className="text-lg italic">The Affordable Care Act (ACA) transformed the individual health insurance market, and its most significant feature is the financial assistance it provides. Understanding if you qualify—and for what—is the first step toward securing affordable, quality health coverage.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">The Two Types of ACA Financial Assistance</h2>
            <p>The ACA created two distinct types of subsidies to make both premiums and out-of-pocket costs more manageable for millions of Americans. Your eligibility for each is determined by your income.</p>
            <ol className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-4">
                <li>
                    <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Premium Tax Credits (PTC):</strong> This is the most common form of assistance. The PTC is a refundable tax credit designed to lower your monthly insurance premiums. It's often called a "subsidy." You can choose to have it paid directly to your insurance company each month to reduce your premium, or you can pay the full premium yourself and claim the entire credit when you file your federal income tax return. Your eligibility and the amount of your credit are based on a sliding scale. The lower your income, the higher your tax credit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Cost-Sharing Reductions (CSR):</strong> This is an "extra" subsidy that helps lower your out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. You are eligible for CSRs <strong className="text-foreground">only</strong> if your income is between 100% and 250% of the FPL, and you <strong className="text-foreground">must</strong> enroll in a Silver-level plan on the Marketplace to receive these benefits. This is a crucial point; if you choose a Bronze, Gold, or Platinum plan, you will not get cost-sharing reductions, even if your income qualifies. CSRs automatically lower the deductible, copayments, and max out-of-pocket limit of a Silver plan, making it function more like a Gold or Platinum plan without the higher premium.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">The Key Metrics: MAGI and FPL</h2>
            <p>Your eligibility for everything is determined by two key numbers, which this calculator uses:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI):</strong> This is the figure the Marketplace uses to determine your income. It's not simply your salary. MAGI is your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) from your tax return plus certain non-taxable income, such as tax-exempt interest and non-taxable Social Security benefits. For most people, MAGI is very close to or the same as their AGI. It is the combined income of everyone in your tax household who is required to file a tax return.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Federal Poverty Level (FPL):</strong> This is an income figure, set annually by the federal government, used to determine eligibility for a wide range of benefits, including ACA subsidies. The FPL varies by household size—the more people in your household, the higher the FPL. This calculator uses the official FPL figures to determine your income as a percentage of the poverty level.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">Navigating the Subsidy Tiers</h2>
            <p>Your FPL percentage places you into a specific eligibility category:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Below 100% FPL: The Coverage Gap</strong>
                    <p>In states that have <strong className="text-foreground">not</strong> expanded Medicaid, individuals with incomes below the poverty line fall into the "coverage gap." They earn too much to qualify for their state's traditional Medicaid program but too little to qualify for ACA premium subsidies (which start at 100% FPL). This is a difficult position, and individuals in this situation should seek out community health centers or other local resources.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Below 138% FPL: Medicaid Expansion</strong>
                    <p>In the majority of states that <strong className="text-foreground">have</strong> expanded Medicaid, adults with household incomes up to 138% of the FPL are eligible for free or very low-cost coverage through Medicaid. If your income falls in this range and you live in an expansion state, you will likely be directed to your state's Medicaid agency to apply.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">100% to 400% FPL: The Heart of the Subsidies</strong>
                    <p>This is the primary group targeted by the ACA's premium tax credits. The amount of your subsidy is calculated to ensure that the premium for the "second-lowest-cost silver plan" (the benchmark plan) in your area will not cost you more than a certain percentage of your income (from about 2% up to 8.5%). As noted earlier, if you are between 100% and 250% FPL, you are also eligible for powerful cost-sharing reductions if you enroll in a Silver plan.</p>
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Above 400% FPL: The End of the "Subsidy Cliff"</strong>
                    <p>Prior to 2021, if your income was even one dollar over 400% FPL, you lost all eligibility for subsidies, a situation known as the "subsidy cliff." The Inflation Reduction Act has eliminated this cliff through the end of 2025. Now, individuals and families with incomes above 400% FPL can still receive a subsidy. The assistance is designed so that the benchmark Silver plan premium will not exceed 8.5% of their household income. This has provided critical financial relief for many middle-income families, early retirees, and self-employed individuals in high-cost areas.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion: Knowledge is Your Best Tool</h2>
            <p>Healthcare affordability is a major concern for most American families. The ACA subsidy system, while complex, provides a powerful mechanism to make coverage attainable. By using this calculator to get a clear estimate of your eligibility, you can approach the Health Insurance Marketplace with confidence. You'll know whether you should be looking for Medicaid, expecting a significant premium tax credit, or focusing your search on Silver plans to take advantage of cost-sharing reductions. This knowledge allows you to find the best possible coverage that fits your family's budget and healthcare needs.</p>

              <p className="text-muted-foreground">For Marketplace purposes, your household typically includes the tax filer, their spouse, and anyone they claim as a tax dependent. It's based on how you expect to file your taxes for the coverage year.</p>

             <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg">
              <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">What if my income changes during the year?</h4>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">It is very important to report any income changes to the Marketplace as soon as possible. If your income goes up, your subsidy amount may decrease. If you don't report it, you might have to pay back the excess subsidy when you file your taxes. Conversely, if your income goes down, you might be eligible for a larger subsidy, lowering your monthly payments.</p>

             <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg">
              <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">What is the "benchmark plan"?</h4>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">The actual dollar amount of your premium tax credit is tied to the price of the "second-lowest-cost Silver plan" (SLCSP) available to you in your area. This is known as the benchmark plan. The subsidy is calculated to cover the difference between the benchmark plan's premium and the percentage of your income you're expected to contribute.</p>

                <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">Can I get a subsidy if my employer offers health insurance?</h4>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground">Generally, no. If you have an offer of what the IRS considers "affordable" and "adequate" coverage from an employer, you are typically not eligible for a subsidy on the Marketplace. For 2024, coverage is considered affordable if the employee's share of the premium for the lowest-cost self-only plan is less than 8.39% of the household income.</p>

                <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">What is the "Medicaid expansion" and how do I know if my state has it?</h4>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground">The ACA allowed states to expand their Medicaid programs to cover nearly all adults with incomes up to 138% of the FPL. Most, but not all, states have done so. You can find out if your state has expanded Medicaid by checking the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) website, which maintains an up-to-date status map.</p>

            <p>This calculator provides a straightforward estimate of your eligibility for financial assistance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). By comparing your income and household size to the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), it determines whether you are likely eligible for Medicaid in expansion states, a Premium Tax Credit (subsidy) on the Marketplace, or both. This initial check is the most critical first step in understanding how to access affordable health insurance for you and your family.</p>
